# openSSL-Project-Summer-2022
I did this project for the Cryptography and cryptanalysis course in the Summer 2022 semester at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

Report: This project is about Encryption and decryption with OpenSSL. This project taught me the difference between a command 
line of OpenSSL and the use of every commands. It introduced how to find files in a different directory. From the beginning of how to 
check the other version of the OpenSSL to opening an additional text file and using a different guide. It shows about the encryption 
method and also the decryption method. I have Encrypted and decrypted text by using private and public keys. It project also shows how 
to use a number of bytes. I will implement all the different sections I learned from the project. 

This project mainly talks about how both parties generate public and private keys. And also it talks about how public keys are shared with all the people
to decrypt the message they sent.
